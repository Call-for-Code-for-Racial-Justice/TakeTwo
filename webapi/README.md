# TakeTwoÂ Solution Starter - WebAPI Backend

TakeTwo provides a quick and simple tool to help detect and eliminate racial bias -- both overt and subtle -- in written content. This can assist content creators in proactively mitigating potential biases as they write. It can also be used by people to review written content on websites and social media for potential biases.

## Introduction

The TakeTwo solution provides a quick and simple tool for **content platforms** to detect and eliminate racial bias (both overt and subtle) from their content.

This API is underpinned by a crowd-sourced database of words and phrases that are deemed racially biased. These phrases are categorized in order to train an AI model on the significance of the context in which the language was used. Contributors to the project can be part of the crowdsourcing process by installing a browser extension. This API repo is part of the data capture process, which is used for modelling.

1. A media content editor (e.g., audio, gaming, movies, tv, comics, news, publications) can incorporate bias detection and remediation into their creative process to reduce racial bias and improve representation to Gen Z.

2. A social media user can understand the historical and societal context of racial bias and cultural appropriation reflected in their posts in real time.

We have identified the following issues currently faced by **content platforms**:

- Racially biased content created due to lack of context and information.
- The possibility to perpetuate bias through content.
- Offensive and hurtful language that can cause others pain.

This project aims to facilitate **content platforms** to:

- Flag words and phrases that may contain racial bias.
- Categorize the type of racial bias that may be present.
- Amend text to reduce the possibility of posting offensive content.
- Become more aware and improve representation in their future content.
- Become a more inclusive platform.

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this tutorial you need:
- Install Python3
- Install Docker

## Estimated time

Completing this tutorial should take about 15 minutes.

## Technology

TakeTwo is built using open source technologies. The API is built using Python, [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), and [Docker](https://www.docker.com) (if running on a Kubernetes cluster).

The data is sent to a backend database. The code is set up to be able to run the API locally with a [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) backend database or [IBM Cloudant](https://www.ibm.com/uk-en/cloud/cloudant) database.

To run with CouchDB, you will need to deploy a CouchDB docker image either locally or on a Kubernetes cluster.

There is a front-end HTML page that serves and example text editor.

### Description of TakeTwo API

This API is part of the Call For Code TakeTwo project. This API is used to capture the data crowdsourced by our contributors through the [Take 2 Chrome extension tool](https://github.com/embrace-call-for-code/taketwo-marker-chromeextension).

The API is used to fetch the defined categories of racial bias and serve them in the extension tool. It also captures the data highlighted by contributors and posts it to a backend database. This data is used to train an [ML model](/datascience/README.md) that can detect racial bias.

## Datasets

The database contains the following fields:

- ``"_id"``: Database field (optional)
- ``"_rev"``: Database field
- ``"user_id"``: *The user ID*
- ``"flagged_string"``: *The word of phrase that has been highlighted by the user.*
- ``"category"``: *The category that has been selected for the type of racial bias present in the highlighted word or phrase.*
- ``"info"``: *Additional information, context description provided by the user.* (optional)
- ``"url"``: *The url from where the word or phrase was highlighted.*


</br>

This project has defined a number of categories of racial bias, which are used by a text classification model (outlined below), however we welcome feedback on these:

- Appropriation
- Stereotyping
- Under-Representation
- Gaslighting
- Racial Slur
- Othering

Definitions of these categories can be found on the TakeTwo [webpage](README.md).

## Getting started

#### Clone the TakeTwo repository

To run this API locally you will need to clone this repo.

```git clone https://github.com/embrace-call-for-code/taketwo.git```

#### Install the Python prerequisites

Navigate into the repo:

```cd taketwo-webapi```

Run the following command to create a virtual environment:

```python3 -m venv env```

Activate virtual environment:

```source env/bin/activate```

Install the packages needed from the requirements.txt file:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Navigate to the folder which contains the API code:

```cd taketwo-webapi```

#### Start a CouchDB container
Before launching the application, set the name of your CouchDB database.

```export DBNAME=taketwodatabase```

To run the API with a CouchDB backend, start a couchDB container before running the main.py code.

```docker run -p 5984:5984 -d -e COUCHDB_USER=admin -e COUCHDB_PASSWORD=password couchdb```

#### Launch the application

Run the Python api code:

```uvicorn main:app --reload```

</br>

### Deploy to Kubernetes

There is already an [image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/josiemundi/taketwo_v0.1) available in Docker hub for this API, which you can use to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster. Alternatively you can build your own using the Dockerfile in this repo. To build a new image, run the following command in a terminal window:

```docker build -t <dockerusername>/taketwo_api .```

To push the image to Docker hub, run the following:

```docker push <dockerusername>/taketwo_api```

</br>

### Use the API

When the API is running, the main url will show an example text editor, which can be used to make requests to the backend data. You can type in the text box and then press check. Text that could be racially biased will be highlighted as shown in the following example.

Open a browser to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
